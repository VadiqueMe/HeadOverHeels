> In summer 2001 I decided to achieve the goal of programming a remake of Head over Heels. The first stage arrived two years later, when I published a beta version of it. That experience was a really extraordinary one; above all, because of all the support I received from so many people that, in one way or another, collaborated to make possible that the project saw finally the light. Although the game credits are a good proof of it, I would specifically mention in these pages the participation, as the graphic designer, of Davit Masiá. Without his work, I could never complete my own one.

However, once I was able to recover my free time and feeling, as I felt, that I had a thorn in my side for not having finished the «remake», I decided to return to the project. Ignacio Pérez Gil had released the 0.3 version of his isometric engine Isomot, and I took it as the basis from which I reconsidered the work. In 2007, with most of the code already finished, I decided to reopen the forum.

I'd like to thank, from my heart, to Santiago Acha, Xavi Colomé, Paco Santoyo and Hendrik Bezuidenhout their support and the good moments they have given me.

I found it in the fall of 2016 and saw that the sources lack a (sup)port for Mac OS X at all, and in particular for OS X on PowerPC,
therefore I began this project on GitHub which eventually evolved into what it is now.
