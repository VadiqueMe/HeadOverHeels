How to install alternative graphic sets.

MICROSOFT WINDOWS
-----------------

The isometric engine looks for the graphic set of the game into "gfx" folder. 
This folder can be found typically at C:\Program files\headoverheels-1.0.0\share\headoverheels.

1. Copy the "gfx.2003", "gfx.riderx" or "gfx.something" folder at C:\Program files\headoverheels-1.0.0\share\headoverheels.
2. Rename the "gfx" folder to, for example, "gfx.2009".
3. Rename the copied folder to "gfx".
4. Start the game.

LINUX AND OTHERS
----------------

The isometric engine looks for the graphic set of the game into "gfx" folder. 
This folder can be found at ${PREFIX}/share/headoverheels. ${PREFIX} usually is /usr/local or /usr.

1. Copy the "gfx.2003", "gfx.riderx" or "gfx.something" folder at ${PREFIX}/share/headoverheels/
2. Rename the current "gfx" folder to, for example, "gfx.2009".
3. Make a symbolic link named "gfx" to the folder you want to select:
   $ ln -s gfx.2003 gfx
4. Start the game.
